There was once a guy named Sahil. He played soccer with his friends.


He became the MVP of the league. Then, he stopped talking to his teammates. WHYYY? 

Because he is so much better than them. He cannot be hanging out with trash.


So, the team went to the finals with Sahil scoring every goal. What a cool guy.
